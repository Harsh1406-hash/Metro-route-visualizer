# Metro Route Visualizer

A graph-based metro route visualization project developed as part of the  
**Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course.

This project demonstrates how graph algorithms can be used to find and
visualize the shortest path between metro stations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To apply graph algorithms in a real-world scenario
- To visualize shortest metro routes interactively
- To strengthen understanding of DAA concepts

---

## 🚀 Features
- Metro stations represented as graph nodes
- Routes represented as weighted edges
- Shortest path calculation between two stations
- Simple and interactive UI

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- Graph (Adjacency List)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm / BFS (based on implementation)

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- `index.html` – User interface
- `script.js` – Core algorithm logic
- `style.css` – Styling

---

## 📚 Academic Use
This project is created for educational purposes under the  
**Design and Analysis of Algorithms** subject.
